## Project Overview

[Delta Theta Investment PTY LTD](https://redmine.cecs.anu.edu.au/redmine/projects/financial-markets-algorithmic-trading-part-ii) 

Algorithmic trading is crucial for financial markets. This transformation is anchored in the deployment of sophisticated algorithms capable of executing trades at speeds and volumes unattainable by human traders. The significance of algorithmic trading is underscored by its capacity to enhance market liquidity through market-making strategies, narrow the bid-ask spread via high-frequency trading, swiftly capitalize on mispricing through arbitrage strategies, and reduce overall trading costs. These benefits collectively contribute to a more robust and efficient market environment, facilitating easier and more cost-effective trading mechanisms for participants.

Broadly, trading strategies could be categorized into technical and fundamental types of strategies. Technical strategies, including trend following and momentum, mean reversion and statistical arbitrage, along with high-frequency trading and market making, rely on historical price data and mathematical models to forecast market movements. Conversely, fundamental strategies focus on intrinsic value assessments through the analysis of financial statements, economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment derived from news and social media. These approaches offer diverse pathways for exploiting market opportunities, each with its unique advantages and challenges.

## Project Objectives
Our project's primary objective is to develop an algorithmic trading strategy and aims to achieve the following key outcomes:
#### Strategy Development and Optimization
Develop and refine algorithmic trading strategies tailored to the unique characteristics of cryptocurrency and equity markets. Optimise strategies through rigorous backtesting, considering various market conditions, to enhance performance, profitability, and risk management.
#### Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
Create comprehensive documentation detailing the research, development, testing, and optimization phases of the project. Facilitate knowledge transfer by providing Delta Theta Investment PTY LTD with insights into the implemented strategies, enabling informed decision-making.
#### Continuous Improvement
Establish a foundation for ongoing improvement and innovation in algorithmic trading strategies by fostering a culture of curiosity and exploration.
#### Final Goal
By collaborating with another team and dividing tasks accordingly, we aim to ultimately implement our strategy into practical application within the trading core.
