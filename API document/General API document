Option strategy examples: 
Now:
Short Straddle : The short straddle strategy is based on the investor's expectation that the market will remain stable, allowing them to profit from selling both call and put options when price fluctuations are minimal. The maximum profit is the premium received, while the maximum loss is theoretically unlimited. The specific steps are as follows: First, use the get_historical_stock_price API to analyze the stock's historical price data and determine its volatility. Next, use the get_current_price and get_option_price APIs to obtain the current market price and option premiums to select the appropriate strike price. Then, use the get_dividend_paid and get_riskfree_rate APIs to acquire dividend and risk-free rate data for option pricing and risk assessment. Finally, based on this analysis, sell a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date to construct the short straddle strategy. 
Naked Call (Put): As the development team, we provide a suite of APIs that help investors gain comprehensive insights into historical stock prices, current market prices, option premiums, dividend payments, and risk-free rates, enabling them to construct and implement a naked call strategy. The naked call strategy involves selling a call option without owning the underlying stock, based on the investor's expectation that the stock price will not rise significantly. The maximum profit is the premium received, while the maximum loss is theoretically unlimited if the stock price rises sharply. 
Maybe Future:
We will use long call/put and short call/put to form more and more effective strategies in the future. Below are just some possible examples.
This approach predicts high volatility. One common strategy that could benefit from this API is the Straddle(long). A straddle involves buying both a call and a put option for the same stock with the same strike price and expiration date. Traders use this strategy when they expect significant price movement but are unsure of the direction. Historical price data helps in determining the volatility of the stock, which is a key factor in the profitability of a straddle.
This method predicts less volatility. Another strategy is the Iron Condor, which involves selling one call and one put at higher and lower strike prices while buying another call and put at even higher and lower strike prices, respectively. This strategy profits from low volatility, and historical stock prices can help traders identify periods of stability to implement this strategy effectively.
This approach is more conservative and favors less volatility. Additionally, Covered Call Writing can benefit from this API. This strategy involves holding a long position in a stock while selling a call option on the same stock. Historical price data is essential to determine the optimal strike price and expiration date for the call options to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

Fundamental analysis examples：
Now:
Our research team is currently focusing on analyzing the linear relationship between the Price-to-Earnings (PE) Ratio and the Price-to-Book (PB) Ratio. We have gathered extensive financial data from numerous companies and are utilizing linear regression models to explore the potential relationship between these two key financial indicators. Additionally, we are employing k-means clustering algorithms to group the data, aiming to identify clusters of companies with similar PE and PB characteristics. Concurrently, we are using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to extract the main features from the data and simplify the analysis process. Preliminary results indicate that there is a certain linear relationship between PE and PB Ratios, distinct characteristics in different company clusters identified by k-means, and PCA has helped us identify several significant principal components.

Two possible strategies for the future:
Multivariate Regression and Advanced Regression Models Strategy:
Building on our initial findings of the linear relationship, we plan to further employ multivariate regression and advanced models such as ridge regression. By incorporating additional financial indicators (e.g., ROE, earnings growth rate) and macroeconomic variables, we aim to more accurately describe the relationship between PE and PB Ratios. Optimizing these models will enhance our ability to predict future market performance of companies, which can be applied to our investment decision-making process.
Portfolio Investment Strategy Based on Clustering Results:
Utilizing the characteristics of company clusters identified through k-means clustering, we intend to develop a portfolio investment strategy. Specifically, we will select companies with superior financial
